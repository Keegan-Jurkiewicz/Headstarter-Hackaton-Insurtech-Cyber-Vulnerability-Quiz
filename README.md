## Prompt ( Useing Gemini )

What questions would I need to ask in a how vulnerable are you to cyber crime quiz whose answers will be pasted to an ai agent in the back end with a wrapper to come up with an answer in a scale from 1 to 100. This needs to be replicable across many uses.


Answer: 

## Designing a Cyber Vulnerability Quiz for an AI Agent

### Key Considerations
* **Replicability:** Questions should be clear, concise, and easily understandable.
* **Comprehensiveness:** Cover a wide range of cyber security aspects.
* **Quantifiability:** Answers should be easily convertible into numerical values.
* **AI Compatibility:** Data format should be suitable for AI processing.

### Potential Question Categories

1. **Network Security**
   * How many devices are connected to your network?
   * Do you use a firewall? If yes, what type?
   * How often do you update your network devices?

2. **Endpoint Security**
   * Do you use antivirus software on all devices?
   * How often do you update your operating system and software?
   * Do you have a policy for strong password creation?

3. **Data Security**
   * How do you protect sensitive data (encryption, access controls)?
   * Do you regularly back up your data?
   * How do you dispose of old hardware and data?

4. **Employee Training**
   * How often do you conduct cybersecurity training for employees?
   * Do you have a policy for reporting suspicious emails or activities?
   * Do you have a remote work policy with security measures?

5. **Incident Response**
   * Do you have an incident response plan?
   * Do you test your incident response plan regularly?
   * Do you have cyber insurance?

### Question Structure
* **Multiple Choice:** While this might limit the depth of information, it simplifies data processing.
* **Likert Scale:** Questions like "How confident are you in your network security?" can provide nuanced answers.
* **Yes/No:** For straightforward questions about security measures.
* **Open-ended:** While less suitable for automated processing, can provide valuable qualitative data.

### Example Questions
* How many employees have access to sensitive customer data?
* Do you regularly monitor your network for unusual activity?
* Do you have a dedicated cybersecurity team or consultant?
* How often do you review your cybersecurity policies and procedures?

### Data Structure
* **Question ID:** Unique identifier for each question.
* **Question Text:** The actual question.
* **Answer Options:** Possible answers with assigned values (e.g., 1-5).
* **Weight:** The relative importance of the question in determining the overall vulnerability score.

### AI Agent Processing
* **Data Input:** The user's answers are fed into the AI agent.
* **Data Cleaning:** Remove inconsistencies or missing data.
* **Data Weighting:** Apply weights to different questions based on their importance.
* **Score Calculation:** Calculate a vulnerability score based on the weighted answers.
* **Output:** Provide a vulnerability score on a scale of 1-100.

By carefully designing the questions and the AI agent's processing logic, you can create a reliable and informative cyber vulnerability assessment tool.
